# Cursor Rules for Eventyay

1. Read `agents.md` first; it is the single source of truth.
2. Apply matching scoped rules in `.github/instructions/*.md` for each edited file.
3. Keep edits minimal and in requested scope.
4. Preserve core safety rules:
   - Event data queries use `scope(event=event)`.
   - New imports use `eventyay.*`, not legacy namespaces.
   - JavaScript uses external ES modules (no jQuery, no inline scripts).

Do not duplicate or override project policy in this file.
