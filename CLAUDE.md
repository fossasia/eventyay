# Claude Instructions for Eventyay

Canonical project policy is in [`agents.md`](agents.md). Read that first.

Apply matching scoped rules in `.github/instructions/*.md` for each edited file.

## Claude-Specific Defaults

- State assumptions briefly before large or risky changes.
- For multi-step work, give a short plan, then execute.
- Keep explanations concise and tied to the modified files.

Do not duplicate or override project rules in this file. Use `agents.md` as the single source of truth.
