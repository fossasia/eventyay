# Codex Instructions for Eventyay

Canonical project policy is in [`agents.md`](agents.md). Read that first.

Apply matching scoped rules in `.github/instructions/*.md` for each edited file.

## Codex-Specific Defaults

- Make minimal diffs focused on the requested scope.
- Preserve existing project patterns before introducing new abstractions.
- Run targeted lint/tests for touched areas when feasible.

Do not duplicate or override project rules in this file. Use `agents.md` as the single source of truth.
