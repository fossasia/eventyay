Support & Services
==================

Eventyay is an open-source project developed by FOSSASIA. We provide professional services to help organizations successfully use eventyay for their events.

Whether you're looking for a hassle-free hosted solution, custom feature development, or dedicated technical support, we offer several options to meet your needs. For inquiries about any of these services, please contact sales@eventyay.com.

Hosted Service
--------------

The easiest way to use eventyay is through our hosted service at `eventyay.com`_.
We provide professional hosting of eventyay for events of all sizes, with pricing that scales based on your event's needs. Community events and non-profit organizations may be eligible for discounts.

With our hosted service, you benefit from:

* Automatic backups and updates
* First access to new features and bug fixes  
* Professional technical support
* No server management required

Feature Sponsorship
-------------------

Organizations can sponsor the development of specific features they need for their events.
This provides tangible benefits with clear deliverables - you know exactly what you're getting.

When you sponsor a feature:

* The feature becomes part of the open-source codebase for everyone
* We acknowledge your organization in the documentation and release notes
* You can help prioritize features important to your use case

If you're looking for ideas, check the sponsorship_ label in the eventyay issue tracker, or contact us with your requirements.

Support Contracts
-----------------

For organizations running their own eventyay instance, we offer support contracts that provide:

* Guaranteed response times
* A set number of support hours per year
* Assistance with upgrades, backups, and configuration
* Priority bug fixes and troubleshooting

We're committed to supporting the open source community. Many organizations successfully self-host eventyay (see our `event showcase`_), and our support contracts are designed to give you peace of mind while maintaining full control of your installation.


--------------------------------

Thank you for supporting eventyay! Whether you choose our hosted service, sponsor features, or self-host with a support contract, your support helps make eventyay better for everyone.

If you'd rather contribute your time and skills, we welcome code contributions, translations, and documentation improvements. See our :ref:`contributing guidelines <contributing>` to get started.
