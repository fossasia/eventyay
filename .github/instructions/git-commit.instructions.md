# Git tool guideline

## Commit
- Write meaningful commit messages and maintain clean Git history.
- The commit message should be concise, short enough to be displayed in one line for most of Git clients. No need to say "Refactor xxx to improve readability and performance". Of course we know that we are refactoring code, and the reason is usually to improve readability and performance. Just say what you did.
- When there are many things to say, the commit message should be split to two parts, separated by a blank line:
  + A short summary line as short as the above rule.
  + A detailed description, can be arbitrary long.
