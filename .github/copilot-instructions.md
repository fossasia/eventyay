# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Eventyay

Canonical project policy is in [`../agents.md`](../agents.md). Read that first.

Apply matching scoped rules in `.github/instructions/*.md` for each edited file.

## Copilot-Specific Defaults

- Keep completions conservative and aligned with nearby code patterns.
- Prefer minimal, local edits over speculative refactors.
- If context is unclear, avoid guessing new architecture and defer to existing project conventions.

Do not duplicate or override project rules in this file. Use `agents.md` as the single source of truth.
